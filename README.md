# DigiDigits
Python script that utilizes a very sneaky little API to get market data for all Digimon cards. 
## Features to come
- Currently working on storing market data every week to create interactive graphs that visualize market price changes for these cards. 
- May attempt to do some time-series forecasting and regression analysis to predict future prices for cards! :)
